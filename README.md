A simple form validation system using JavaScript and regular expressions (regex) to ensure correct user input for registration forms. The form checks for:

Username: Validates that the username contains only letters, numbers, underscores, and periods, with a minimum length of 3 characters.
Password: Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long, contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.
Email: Verifies that the email is in the correct format.
Gender: Requires the user to select a gender.
City: Ensures that a city is selected from a dropdown.
Duplicate Check: Prevents users from entering duplicate usernames or email addresses.
